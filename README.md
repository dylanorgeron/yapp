Yet Another Pallet Picker
Yet Another Pallet Picker - Upload an image, download a theme

[Check in on the progress here!](https://dylanorgeron.github.io/yapp)

YAPP is a project that aims to provide functional, aesthetic themes for VSCode. I got tired
of manually rebuilding my theme everytime I changed my wallpaper, so I developed YAPP to save
myself the effort. YAPP takes an image, extracts a color palette, then modifies those colors
into a usable set of theme colors. Contrast checking, background and foreground enhancement,
and an attempt to comply with the base16 architecture are all part of YAPP's featureset. At 
the moment, VSCode is the only supported editor, but I'd like to eventually add mapping for other
popular editors.
